# Subtle
A small CLI to make checkpoints in files and open them in sublime faster.(for Linux)

## Why this plugin?
Well i used to get very frustrated everytime I wanted to open a sublime folder i had to go in the sublime window click on the File > Open Folder and then select my file from the file explorer.
So well this plugin makes it a bit easier to navigate through the directory and add files that we like to switch constantly.
